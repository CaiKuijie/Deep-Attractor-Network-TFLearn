# Project Deep-Attractor-Network-TFLearn[![Documentation Status](http://danetapi.com/danet)]

Project Deep Attractor Network is an open source single-channel speech separation engine that uses a model trained by machine learning techniques, based on Zhuo Chou(https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567). Project Deep Attractor uses Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) project to facilitate implementation aided by [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/).
